I am a 16 yr old student in the UK

I know how to use: 

- Python

I can make simple python programs and I am currently learning how to use: Sockets, Threading, Pygame, Tkinter (and PyQt5) and a few other modules.

In the future I plan to learn machine learning using modules such as Pytorch, Tensorflow and Keras

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I tried making a website a few times... It never really came to anything interesting ðŸ˜…
